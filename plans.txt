Card deck drawing app that uses Vue
Each card entry has a title, body, and style property
Cards are created with the app, so the card file doesn't have to be super easy to read or anything

let Deck = []; (cards in there)
let Cards = [] + Deck.append

let Card = {
    title:
    body:
    style:
}

iterate Card in Cards

drawCard returns Cards ( random(Cards.length) )

refreshCards {Cards = [] + Deck.append}

drawnCards = []; (drawn cards in there; blanked out with refreshCards)

makeCard {stuff to add a card, probably based on a form or something}
